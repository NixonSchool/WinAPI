🚀 **Welcome to the WinAPI Wormhole!**

Hey, Windows API adventurers! You've just teleported into my WinAPI wonderland. Buckle up!

**What's in store?**

💻 Colorful code (WinAPI is seen as black and white, I mention it and someone already visualizes MS-DOS, and since you like sleep, colors don't allow that...)
📚 Notes that actually make sense (I know, shocking! Clear notes, explained to the core.)
🎢 A rollercoaster ride through the weirdest parts of Windows which you'd have never even thought existed.

**Prerequisites:**

C/C++ programming knowledge. I already have a C repo if you don't mind starting there.
A **love for low-level madness**, unless you're a framework fanatic.
Prohibited: Caffeine (colourful notes need no caffiene, I promise you won't sleep)

🚫 No contributions needed! Unless you're feeling generous. I accept both pull requests, cash and pizzas. 🍕
Remember: Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was a decent WinAPI app. Practice makes perfect... or at least less buggy.

🆓 It's all free! Fork it, clone it, print it out and use it as wallpaper. Go wild!
Follow for more computing adventures where we dig deeper than a framework fanboy. Because who needs abstraction when you can have confusion? 😜
Thanks for dropping by! Now go forth and conquer those window procedures! 💪
